        Category Theory makes (some) algorithms nicer.

        For primitive groups of PA type
        we can construct the normaliser of the socle in polynomial time.

        For primitive groups of PA type
        we can compute the normaliser in quasipolynomial (maybe even
        polynomial?) time.
